## Houses prices modelling

The aim of the project is to analyze data and build model to predict housing prices. Project is based on dataset accessible on Kaggle.com here. Dataset contains information on sold houses in King County (including Seattle) between May 2014 and May 2015. Variables include date of sale, price, number of beedrooms, number of beedrooms, floor area, and more.

Project contains Jupyter Notebook file named “housing_case.ipynb” with:

* Data exploration
* Feature engineering
* Data modelling
* Models evaluation
* Choosen model optimization
