## Houses prices modelling

The aim of the project is to analyze data and build model to predict housing prices. Project is based on dataset accessible on Kaggle.com here. Dataset contains information on sold houses in King County (including Seattle) between May 2014 and May 2015. Variables include date of sale, price, number of beedrooms, number of beedrooms, floor area, and more.

Project contains:

Jupyter notebook file named “housing_case.ipynb”, based on kc_house_data.csv with:

* Data exploration
* Data preparation
* Data modelling
* Regression models evaluation
* Choosen model optimization

Jupyter notebook file named “housing_case_2_reg.ipynb”, based on modified dataset 'house.csv', where also regression problem is solved. It is based on
“housing_case.ipynb” notebook with various improvements. Notebook contains:

* Data exploration
* Data preparation
* Data modelling
* Regression models evaluation
* Choosen model optimization

Jupyter notebook file named “housing_case_2_cls.ipynb”, based on modified dataset 'house.csv', where classification problem is solved. Notebook contains:

* Data exploration
* Data preparation
* Data modelling
* Classification model evaluation
* Choosen model optimization
